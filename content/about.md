Kim is a former pharmaceutical biologist originally from Chicago. Her love for fitness began at an early age as a competitive gymnast. Since then, she has trained as a triathlete and achieved her 1st Dan in Shotokan Karate. Making the jump from her pharmaceutical career, she became an accredited personal trainer and yoga instructor.

Kim’s yoga stems from her love of science and sport. She is welcoming, motivational and teaches to everyone’s unique anatomy. Her classes are filled with the rhythm of breath as you flow into the next pose. You will always leave class with a bit more length, strength, and a sense of calm.
