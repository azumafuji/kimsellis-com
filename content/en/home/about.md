Many people have asked me what type of yoga I teach and my honest answer is always "a bit of everything‚Äù. I like to teach a dynamic vinyasa flow but I also know the benefits of holding poses to promote breath and adding a bit of strength moves into the practice. So I am not one type of yoga, but a bit of everything combined. I also like to promote deep breathing and bits of meditation in my classes.
