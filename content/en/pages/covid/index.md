Even though extra precautions due to Covid-19 are being taken, I am participating at my own risk.  I understand that even if all the guidelines are followed, there is a risk of contracting the virus.

### General Guidelines to be followed
- Following government guidelines and advising all students not to attend classes if they are or think they might be in breach of these (re: return travel, flu like systems etc.).
- Putting in place social distancing measures – all mats at least 3 metres apart (Hogarth Community Center space is 70ft x 20ft., maximum of 14 people at 3m apart, the class size limited to 12 participants) 
- Washing hands on a regular basis (before and after class).
- Remind students to maintain social distancing and to follow signage posted at the venue. 
- When possible a system of one way entrance, one way exit will be used.

### Responsibilities of the Students:
- Participants will be required to bring their own equipment (mat, blocks, straps, pads, etc).  Sharing of equipment will not be allowed.
- Equipment should be cleaned regularly at home.
- Students will be asked to leave the room when they feel a cough or sneeze arise.  They will also be asked to bring a small towel to catch cough/sneezes.
- Students will be asked to show up to class no more than 10 minutes before class and to leave the room directly after class.  This will minimise the congregation of students.
- Upon arriving to class, students will be asked to fill the space from back to front.  This will prevent people from walking around the room “shopping for a good spot”.
- Students will be asked to stay on their mat and not walk around the room.
- Yogis are to use toilets at home before coming to the yoga venue when possible.
- For students who are extremely vulnerable, they will be encouraged to pick a spot closest to a door or window.  They will also be asked to wear a mask during class.

### Responsibilities of the Instructor:
- Consulting with the venue to ensure COVID-19 protocols are being followed.
- Regularly remind students of all guidelines and make this risk assessment available to students.
- Ensuring hand sanitiser is available at the start and end of every class.
- Floor and mat wipes will be available if required.
- The Instructor will avoid hands on adjustments and favour verbal communications instead.
- The Instructor will try to avoid walking around the room and will watch from the front of class.
- The Instructor will keep a list of participants and contact info for each session.  This will help - support track and trace by the local authorities.
- Ensure room is well ventilated before, after and during class. (Opening windows and doors).
- Should there be a medical emergency, during class the instructor will put on a mask and gloves before approaching the student.  
- Should the instructor or anyone in the instructor’s household have flu-like symptoms, classes will be cancelled until the symptoms resolve. 
- The Instructor will wash hands before and after each class.

### Rental Venue:

- It is the responsibility of the rental space owner to clean and disinfect the rooms. Floor and surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected on a regular basis. The instructor will report unclean floors to the office manager. 
- To provide Signage and posters at the venue to help establish social distancing rules and measures.
