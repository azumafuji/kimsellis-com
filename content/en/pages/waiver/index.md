### Assumption of Risk
I state that I wish to participate in yoga activities that may include aerobic exercise, resistance exercise and stretching. I agree to do so at my own risk, I am voluntarily participating, assume all risk of injury to myself, and agree to release and discharge Kim Sellis Yoga from any and all claims or causes of action, known or unknown, arising out of Kim Sellis Yoga.

I will stop exercising immediately if I feel dizzy, faint, light-headed or if I experience any discomfort. Only I can monitor my condition during my workout. I am responsible for exercising within my limits and seeking attention and advice as appropriate. 

Kim Sellis is not a licensed medical care provider and has no expertise in diagnosing, examining, or treating medical conditions of any kind, or in determining the effect of any specific exercise on a medical condition. 

### New Students
Any new student must complete a PAR-Q health form before participating in any class.

### Injuries

It is the responsibility of the client to alert the instructor before class of any injuries or illness that might restrict movement and or interfere with class participation, allowing the instructor to suggest modifications or rest during the class. 

Any changes to my health status (medications, conditions, pregnancy, or injuries) will be immediately communicated to the instructor.

**The instructor has the right to deny class participation due to health concerns or injuries at any time.**

### Cancellations

There will be no refunds unless government restrictions or an act of God require Kim Sellis Yoga to cancel class. If a student needs to cancel their spot, Kim Sellis Yoga must be notified via email (Yoga@kimsellis.com) 24hours in advance. Students will be given the option to be added to a different class of their choice or given a class voucher that is valid for 3 months. In the event of class cancellations due to inclement weather, classes will take place online. Participants will be notified 60mins before class via email/text.
