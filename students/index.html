Once familiar with the poses and basic shapes yogis start to create a practice with smooth transitions and syncing breath to the movement. Vinyasa yoga is an active yoga so you should be able to easily move from the ground to standing positions.</p><p>My classes are flowing movements combined with longer holds to catch our breath. Routines are not entirely focused on stretching. We will also build strength though dynamic movement and isometric holds. Modifications are explained so you can make your practice as challenging as you like. Props are not required but are recommended.</p><h3 id=will-there-be-chanting-and-spiritual-stuff>Will there be chanting and spiritual stuff?</h3><p>My practice stems from a love of sport and science. If I cannot cite the science behind it I don’t teach it. I am interested in getting the best out of your anatomy and to help you find a bit of inner calm. That being said, some classes are focused on sensations, thoughts, and ways we can be more mindful. There are bits of breathing techniques but nothing too crazy. The spiritual journey is yours to find.</p><h3 id=do-i-have-to-be-flexible>Do I have to be flexible?</h3><p>Certainly not! The key is to move through a comfortable range of motion. It’s not about how deep you can stretch… it’s about the sensations you find along the way. Modifications are given to make your practice comfortable and props such as blocks, straps, blankets or towels are recommended.</p><h3 id=still-unsure>Still unsure…</h3><p>You can always try me out for <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHH2vOSl0Qxpv7Lw9wv45Sg>free on Youtube</a>. Slow flow classes will give you an idea of how it all works and are suitable for most levels. The power classes are for those with more yoga experience looking for challenge.</p><h2 id=ready-to-try-a-class>Ready to try a class?</h2><p>All new students are required to complete a PAR-Q form <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKZj-qa40jj4d4bUroU74ALcuhFXrLN-l-uyi7Cl3p4gBAyA/viewform?usp=sf_link">(Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire)</a>. The form will ask a few questions regarding your health and history of injuries. This form should be completed before your first class. An updated form should be submitted every 12months or if there are any changes to your health.</p><h3 id=register-for-a-classclasses><a href=/classes/>Register for a class.</a></h3><p>If you have any further questions please feel free to get in touch!
<a href=mailto:yoga@kimsellis.com>yoga@kimsellis.com</a></p><h3 id=five-things-i-wish-i-knew-as-a-beginner>Five things I wish I knew as a beginner</h3><ul><li><strong>Not every class will end in bliss.</strong> You will have “good” and not so “good” practices… that’s why it is a practice. Just take each practice as it comes, trying not to attach expectations.</li><li><strong>Get PROPS!</strong> Props are not cheats. They will allow you to deepen your practice by adding height, length, support and cushion.</li><li><strong>Your unique anatomy will dictate what your yoga looks like.</strong> Every pose has a traditional alignment cue. However these cues do not work for everyone. We all have different injuries, postural habits, bone shapes and lengths. No two yogis will look the same. Try not to focus on others and try not to beat yourself up if a pose is not accessible. Your yogi greatness is not dictated by the shape your physical practice.</li><li><strong>Breath is everything.</strong> As a beginner we first learn the shape of poses. Then we add in muscle recruitment, lifts, activations, and finding a bit more depth. However the real practice is in the breath. Once you learn to control your breath, deepen it, and sync it with movement you will find mental clarity. After all, yoga without breath is just stretching and gymnastics.</li><li><strong>Know when to say No Thank You.</strong> You are in control of your practice. Just because the yoga teacher cues something doesn’t mean you have to do it. Only you know your body - take care of it. If something doesn’t feel right modify it, come out of the pose, do something else, or find a rest. Why risk injury by over doing it?</li></ul></main></article><footer class=footer><address class=footer__contact><p class=footer__contact__item><span><i class="far fa-envelope"></i></span>
