## Assumption of Risk
I state that I wish to participate in yoga activities that may include aerobic exercise, resistance exercise and stretching. I agree to do so at my own risk, I am voluntarily participating, assume all risk of injury to myself, and agree to release and discharge Kim Sellis Yoga from any and all claims or causes of action, known or unknown, arising out of Kim Sellis Yoga.

I will stop exercising immediately if I feel dizzy, faint, light-headed or if I experience any discomfort. Only I can monitor my condition during my workout. I am responsible for exercising within my limits and seeking attention and advice as appropriate. 

Kim Sellis is not a licensed medical care provider and has no expertise in diagnosing, examining, or treating medical conditions of any kind, or in determining the effect of any specific exercise on a medical condition. 

## New Students
Before participating in class all new student must complete a PAR-Q health form [(Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKZj-qa40jj4d4bUroU74ALcuhFXrLN-l-uyi7Cl3p4gBAyA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Injuries

It is the responsibility of the client to alert the instructor before class of any injuries or illness that might restrict movement and or interfere with class participation, allowing the instructor to suggest modifications or rest during the class. 

Any changes to my health status (medications, conditions, pregnancy, or injuries) will be immediately communicated to the instructor.

**The instructor has the right to deny class participation due to health concerns or injuries at any time.**

## Cancellations/Refunds

There will be no refunds unless government restrictions or an act of God require Kim Sellis Yoga to cancel class.  For outdoor classes, in the event of inclement weather, classes will take place online. Participants will be notified 60mins before class via email/text with a link.
